GA Unit1 Project

For our first project deliverable, I'm building a version of Nim, a simple mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing items from three distinct piles. Players can remove as many items from one single pile during a turn. The player who is left to remove the last remaining piece loses. 

I've decided to implement a computer player that implements the 'minimax' algorithm to beat a human player. 



I wanted to break this game down into solvable pieces, and ensure that each phase worked well before moving on to the next. The first logical step was to create the simple 2 player version that alternates between turns and checks for a win. The logic behind this game is simple, but required a few interesting checks for the win cases.
