GA Unit1 Project

For our first project deliverable, I'm building a version of Nim, a simple mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing items from three distinct piles. Players can remove as many items from one single pile during a turn. The player who is left to remove the last remaining piece loses. 

I've decided to implement a computer player that implements the 'minimax' algorithm to beat a human player.
